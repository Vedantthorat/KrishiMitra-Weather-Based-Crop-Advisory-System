**KrishiMitra** is a smart agriculture platform designed to help farmers make informed crop decisions using **Machine Learning** and **real-time weather data**.  
The system features a clean dashboard for easy navigation and uses a **Random Forest algorithm** to predict the most suitable crop based on soil and climate parameters entered by the user.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters inputs (NPK values, soil type, rainfall, etc.).  
2. The frontend sends this information to the **Random Forest ML model** hosted using Streamlit.  
3. The model processes input and returns the **predicted crop**.  
4. Weather data is fetched using the **OpenWeather API** to complement crop predictions.  
5. Output is displayed on the dashboard in a clean, farmer-friendly format.
